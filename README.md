# Breaking Filter Bubbles Using Social Comparison

This is a very preliminary prototype of filter bubbles research project. Details can be found in the pdf attached to this project.

The code basically fetches tweets from Twitter after the participant gives authorization to our tool. The tool also calculates the biases of tweets based on an API. The tool then mirrors Twitter with the new biases.
